"""
This is a script¹ where I will introduce some of the basic features of Python.
For example, this is a module docstring.

¹ Technically, this is a module, as every Python file is.
  In this course, I will use "script" to refer to modules which are meant to be
  executed directly and not imported. In this case, the module could not be
  imported anyway, because its name is not a valid Python identifier.
